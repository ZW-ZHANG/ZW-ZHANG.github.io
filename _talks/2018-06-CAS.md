Network embedding, which represents nodes in the network by low dimensional vectors, 
has attracted increasing research attention in the past few years. 
Despite remarkable progress, many key problems in network embedding remain unexplored, especially when handling large-scale networks. 
In this talk, I will present our recent works on large-scale network embedding, including how to preserve arbitrary-order proximity, 
how to handle dynamic networks and how to conduct distributed computing. Possible future directions will also be discussed.
