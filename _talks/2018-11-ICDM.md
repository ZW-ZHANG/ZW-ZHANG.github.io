Network embedding has attracted considerable research
attention recently. However, the existing
methods are incapable of handling billion-scale
networks, because they are computationally expensive
and, at the same time, difficult to be accelerated
by distributed computing schemes. 

To address
these problems, we propose RandNE, a novel and
simple billion-scale network embedding method.
Specifically, we propose a Gaussian random projection
approach to map the network into a lowdimensional
embedding space while preserving the
high-order proximities between nodes. To reduce
the time complexity, we design an iterative projection
procedure to avoid the explicit calculation
of the high-order proximities. Theoretical analysis
shows that our method is extremely efficient, and
friendly to distributed computing schemes without
any communication cost in the calculation. We
demonstrate the efficacy of RandNE over state-ofthe-
art methods in network reconstruction and link
prediction tasks on multiple datasets with different
scales, ranging from thousands to billions of nodes
and edges.
