In the last decade, deep learning has been a 'crown jewel' in artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
However, utilizing deep learning methods for analyzing the ubiquitous graph data is a non-trivial problem, 
which attracted considerable research attention in the past few years. In this guest lecture, I will present the categorization 
of graph-based deep learning methods and review these methods following their history of developments and how these methods solve challenges of graphs. 
Finally, I will discuss potential future directions. More details can be found in our survey paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04202.
